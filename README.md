# PythonGame
This is a game currently under developement by two people. All things listed below are subject to change.

The idea of the game was to have a monster battle style similar to Pokemon but with a farming part, possibly similar to Harvest Moon, that you need in order to
gather materials and food for your monsters.

The game will have a set of base animals, such as cows, wolves, rats etc. You then combine essences, which can obtained in a variety of ways including farming or exploring, to determine
the type of monster; e.g. a fire essesnce on a cow would make a fire cow. This will then effect the set moves of the animal, so 
the cows tackle will also have the option to have fire tackle etc.

As well as a primary attribute, monsters will also have a secondary attribute. This can be used to combine with moves of the primary to make some unique moves, for example a water primary would give a wave attack. If you have secondary at electricity then this will create a electric wave attack.

##Current Work

Battle
First Implementaion at battle will be just be with the cow.

1. Animations 
  - Attacks
  - Stationary
  
2. Damage System

This will include health and damage

Dodge/ Miss chances
  Dodge mechanic (direction based)

3. Turns
Should be fairly simple to build.

##ToDo
###Farming
Farming will consist of small plot of land which you grow crops on.
Your farm will be your base area where you spend time upgrading, resting and storing monsters.

More details of farm and mechanics are yet to be discussed.

###Side Scrolling
This is the portion of the game that allows for monster discovery and starting of battles.
It will also incorporte navigation of the farm to view crops and current monsters.

##Later Potential Tasks
- Complex battle mechanic e.g. low lick more dmg more weight
- Bosses
- NPC's
- Complex plants (used for healing, status removal or to build repel or attractants)

##Notes
Defeating monster drops egg for that monster and also essessce seed of its type e.g
fire cow drops fire essence seed and cow egg.
