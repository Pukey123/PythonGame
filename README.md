# PythonGame
This is a game currently under developement by two people. 

The idea of the game was to have a monster battle style similar to Pokemon but with a farming part that you need in order to
gather materials and food for your monsters.

The game will have a set of base animals, such as cows, pigs, mice etc. You then combine essesnaces which you farm to determin
the type of monster so a fire essesnce on a cow would make a fire cow. This will then effect the set moves of the animal. So 
the cows tackle will also have the option to have fire tackle etc.

As well as a primary you will also have a secondary attribute. This you can combine with moves of the primary to make some unique moves
for example a water primary would give a wave attack. If you have secondary at electricity then this will create a electric wave attack.
